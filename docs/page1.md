# Introduction to Genesys

Welcome to the Genesys module, a powerful tool for simulating and optimizing microgrids.

In this page, we'll provide an overview of the main components and features of the Genesys module.

## Main Components

The Genesys module includes the following main components:

- Assets: Microgrid components, such as demand, solar, liion, thermal storage, and grid.
- Scenarios: Tools for generating and reducing scenarios for simulations.
- Optimization: Design and operation optimization tools, including controllers and designers.
- Simulation: Functions for simulating microgrids over different time horizons and scenarios.
- Utils: Utilities for metrics, plotting, and data saving.

## Key Features

The Genesys module offers a wide range of features for microgrid simulations and optimizations:

- A flexible and extensible structure that allows for the incorporation of different asset types and optimization algorithms.
- A comprehensive set of optimization tools, including dummy, anticipative, rule-based control, and online learning for frequency control.
- Scenario generation and reduction techniques for efficient and accurate simulations.
- Built-in plotting and metrics utilities for easy analysis and visualization of results.
